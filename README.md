This repository holds _example_ codes to get phylogenies using different methods, simulate community data, calculate and compare phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity, simulate functional traits, and calculate phylogenetic signals of traits.

It is not 100% reproducible here because of the _large_ files produced by simulations. Also it took a long time to finish all the simulations and calculations.
